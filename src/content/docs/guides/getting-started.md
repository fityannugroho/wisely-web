<h3>What is Wisely?</h3>

**Wisely** is a npm package that allows you to obfuscate text or phrases with random uncommon characters.

## Motivation

Everyone is free to speak as long as they do so **wisely**. This is the reason why we created this package, to obscure sensitive text or phrases so that they are difficult for machines to detect, but still readable by humans.

## Try it out

You can try it out in the [online playground](/playground/).
