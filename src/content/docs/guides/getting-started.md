<h3>What is Wisely?</h3>

**Wisely** is a Node.js package that allows you to obfuscate text or phrases with random uncommon characters.

The package is published on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wisely) and [GitHub](https://github.com/fityannugroho/wisely) under the **MIT license**.

## Motivation

Everyone is free to speak as long as they do so **wisely**. This is the reason why we created this package, to obscure sensitive text or phrases so that they are difficult for machines to detect, but still readable by humans.

## Try it out

We have provided the [**playground**](/playground/) for you to try out Wisely without installing it.
